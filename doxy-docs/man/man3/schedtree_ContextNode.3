The context describes constraints on the parameters and the schedule dimensions of outer bands that the AST
   generator may assume to hold. It is also the only kind of node that may introduce additional parameters.
   The space of the context is that of the flat product of the outer band nodes. In particular, if there are no
   outer band nodes, then this space is the unnamed zero-dimensional space. Since a context node references the
   outer band nodes, any tree containing a context node is considered to be anchored.
