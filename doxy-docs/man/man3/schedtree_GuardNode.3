A guard node describes constraints on the symbolic constants and the schedule dimensions of outer bands that
   need to be enforced by the outer nodes in the generated AST. This allows the user to rely on a given set of
   constraints being enforced at a given point in the schedule tree, independently of the simplification of guards
   performed by the AST generator.
