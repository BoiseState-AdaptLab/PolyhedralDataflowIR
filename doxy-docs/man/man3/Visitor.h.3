.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
\fBVisitor\fP base class for expressions\&.h and \fBset_relation\&.h\fP\&. 

Usage: See \fBVisitorDebugTest\fP in set_relation_test for an example\&. You do not have to overload every visit method below\&. Just overload those that your feature needs to do something at\&. The preVisit methods should be called on a node before the acceptVisit method is called on children nodes and the postVisit method could be called after acceptVisit has been called on children nodes\&.
